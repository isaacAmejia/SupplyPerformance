This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a supply chain dataset containing over 180,000 entries to assess and improve delivery performance. The dataset focuses on tracking delivery delays and categorizing shipments based on various factors such as product type, region, and shipping mode. By organizing the data into meaningful categories, the analysis enables users to quickly identify key trends and areas requiring attention to optimize supply chain operations.

To begin, a "Late Deliveries" column and a "Delivery Delayed" flag were created to track shipments that took longer than expected. This allowed for a clear distinction between on-time and delayed deliveries. Pivot tables were then used to aggregate and analyze key metrics such as sales, average delay days, and the number of delayed shipments. The tables are interactive, allowing users to filter data by Category, Order Status, Order Region, and Shipping Mode. This filtering capability provides users with the flexibility to drill down into specific subsets of the data, making it easier to understand patterns and identify trouble spots in the supply chain.

In addition to the pivot tables, three bar charts were created to visualize trends and relationships between various factors contributing to delayed shipments. These visualizations make it easier to digest complex data and highlight important correlations, such as the impact of shipping mode or region on delivery times. The charts are designed to be easily interpretable, providing valuable insights at a glance.

To enhance usability and streamline the process, macros were added to automate the refreshing of the workbook. With the press of a button, users can quickly update all tables and charts, ensuring the data remains current without requiring manual intervention. The use of macros simplifies the workflow, making the workbook more efficient and user-friendly.

The primary use case for this project is supply chain optimization. With the ability to filter data and visualize trends, users can easily identify regions, product types, and shipping modes that are most prone to delays. This allows businesses to focus their efforts on areas that need improvement. Additionally, managers and analysts can monitor performance over time, assess how different factors impact delivery efficiency, and make data-driven decisions to enhance overall supply chain performance.

Throughout this project, several skills and tools were utilized, including Excel Pivot Tables for organizing and analyzing large datasets, data filtering for detailed exploration of specific categories, and data visualization techniques like bar charts to present insights clearly. The implementation of macros automated repetitive tasks, making the workbook more efficient. Overall, the project showcases the power of Excel as a tool for supply chain performance analysis, offering both detailed insights and an easy-to-use interface.
